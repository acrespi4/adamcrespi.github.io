<p>
During my four-month internship at <strong>IRDI System</strong>, I worked as an <strong>R&D Test Engineer Intern</strong>, focusing on firmware testing, hardware validation, and embedded system development. I collaborated with engineers on the <strong>diagnostic receiver product</strong> used for <strong>hydrogen vehicle refueling</strong> and was involved in <strong>both software and hardware optimization</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Firmware Testing & Validation:</strong> Conducted edge-case testing on embedded firmware using JTAG Debuggers.</li>
  <li><strong>Hydrogen Fueling System Analysis:</strong> Designed test messages following the SAE J2799 standard.</li>
  <li><strong>Hardware Development:</strong> Built and tested an ultra-cold freezer system for component evaluation.</li>
  <li><strong>NFC & Embedded Software Development:</strong> Developed NDEF-compliant firmware for NFC communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing Process Optimization:</strong> Improved production by switching to laser engraving.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major Projects</h2>

<h3>ðŸ”¹ Diagnostic Receiver Firmware Testing</h3>
<p>Created a robust testing framework for hydrogen vehicle diagnostic receivers using JTAG debugging tools.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”¹ NFC Integration with Embedded Systems</h3>
<p>Implemented Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality using C programming, developing NDEF-compliant message formats.</p>

<h3>ðŸ”¹ Ultra-Cold Freezer Development</h3>
<p>Designed and assembled a custom ultra-cold freezer for temperature-sensitive component testing.</p>

<h2>Skills Gained</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Embedded Firmware Development</li>
  <li>Hardware Debugging & Validation</li>
  <li>NFC & Wireless Communication</li>
  <li>Automated Firmware Testing</li>
  <li>Hydrogen Fueling Standards (SAE J2799)</li>
  <li>PCB Testing & Optimization</li>
  <li>JTAG Debugging & Low-Level Testing</li>
</ul>

<h2>Takeaways & Future Applications</h2>
<p>
This experience provided me with hands-on exposure to real-world embedded systems and firmware-hardware integration. I developed strong troubleshooting skills, learned to work with cutting-edge diagnostic tools, and optimized manufacturing processes for better efficiency.
</p>
<p>
Moving forward, these skills will directly contribute to my work in robotics, Edge AI, and real-time embedded control systems.
