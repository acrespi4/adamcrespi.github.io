<p>
During my four-month internship at <strong>IRDI System</strong>, I worked as an <strong>Embedded Software Intern</strong>, focusing on firmware testing, hardware validation, and embedded system development. I collaborated with engineers on the <strong>diagnostic receiver product</strong> used for <strong>hydrogen vehicle refueling</strong> and was involved in <strong>both software and hardware optimization</strong>.
</p>

<h3>IRDI System - Hydrogen Vehicle Refueling</h3>
<p>
  IRDI System specializes in developing advanced **diagnostic and refueling technologies** for **hydrogen-powered vehicles**. Their products ensure **safe, efficient, and standardized** hydrogen refueling by implementing **SAE J2799 protocols** and cutting-edge **sensor-driven validation systems**. By integrating **firmware, embedded electronics, and real-time data monitoring**, IRDI System plays a crucial role in advancing the **hydrogen fuel infrastructure** for sustainable transportation.
