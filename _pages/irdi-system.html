<p>
  IRDI System specializes in developing advanced diagnostic and refueling technologies for hydrogen-powered vehicles. Their products ensure safe, efficient, and standardized hydrogen refueling by implementing SAE J2799 protocols. By integrating firmware and embedded electronics, IRDI System plays a crucial role in advancing the hydrogen fuel infrastructure for sustainable transportation.

<h2>Major Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Design Verifcation and Firmware Validation:</strong> I led the full design verification testing for a new product, overseeing the validation of firmware, electrical design, battery performance, and mechanical integrity. Using a JTAG Debugger, I conducted rigorous edge-case testing on the embedded firmware to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure system reliability. Specifically, I worked a lot with CRC and both-byte transparency, to ensure compliance to the J2799 Standard.</li>

  <br>
  <br>
  
  <li><strong>Hardware Development:</strong>Recognizing the need for a temperature cycling system to stress test our product under extreme conditions, I took the initiative to design and build a fully automated robotic temperature cycler. I proposed the project and led its development, repurposing an ultracold vaccine freezer and integrating a robotic arm to automate the testing process. Within just a few weeks, I had the system fully functional, achieving rapid 4-minute test cycles from 20°C down to -60°C..</li>
  <li><strong>NFC Development:</strong> I worked on NDEF-compatible NFC system development for a potential product line. This involved researching NFC communication standards and implementing secure data exchange protocols</li>
