# Exploratory Research in Game Theoretic Control Algorithms

I am excited to share that I have recently begun exploring research in the area of game theoretic control algorithms in collaboration with [Prof. Dominic Liao-McPherson](http://aocl.mech.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. This nascent project aims to leverage insights from algorithmic game theory to design control strategies for multi-agent systems with competing objectives.

## Potential Research Directions

While the research is in its early stages, we are considering several promising ideas, including:

- **Multi-Agent Coordination:**  
  Investigating how game theoretic principles can be used to coordinate control strategies among distributed agents. The goal is to design frameworks where agents with different, and sometimes conflicting, objectives can operate together efficiently and safely.

- **Real-Time Decision Making:**  
  Exploring the integration of game theory with real-time control algorithms. This involves developing methods that enable rapid decision-making in dynamic environments while balancing the trade-offs between individual agent performance and overall system stability.

- **Robust Optimization Under Conflict:**  
  Considering approaches for optimization-based control where agents may have competing goals. Early ideas include creating algorithms that find equilibrium solutions which are robust to uncertainties in both the agents' models and the environment.

- **Applications Across Domains:**  
  While the focus is on foundational algorithm development, potential applications could range from robotics and energy systems to smart infrastructure. These ideas are still very much in the conceptual phase.

## Next Steps

As this research is just getting off the ground, the work will be exploratory and iterative. I look forward to refining these ideas, testing initial prototypes, and eventually sharing more detailed findings and potential real-world applications.

Stay tuned for future updates as this research direction evolves.
